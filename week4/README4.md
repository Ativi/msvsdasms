- A one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is the simplest form of ADC, which is capable of converting an analog signal into a digital signal with only one bit of resolution. This means that the output of the ADC can only take on one of two possible values, typically represented as "0" or "1".

- In a one-bit ADC, the analog signal is compared to a fixed reference voltage, and the output of the ADC is determined by whether the analog signal is greater or less than the reference voltage. This process is repeated multiple times per second to generate a digital output that represents the amplitude of the analog signal over time.
